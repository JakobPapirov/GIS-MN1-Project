Files presented in this folder contain Python code, however, the file-ending is .cal, because the code was exported from ArcMap 10.8, within the Field Calculator.
Because GH can't interpret .cal files I've renamed them into .py files.

Rename the files back to .cal if you wish to import them into ArcMap. However not all files worked.

update which did work.
